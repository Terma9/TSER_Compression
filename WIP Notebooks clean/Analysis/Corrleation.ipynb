    "- Correlation Analysis on TRAIN Set: Same as for TEST, just to get y value let the pkl. model run and get the target value!\n",
    "- When redoing runs, consider keeping more features! (Maybe no AutoMl featuere selectin! Or analyse both!)\n",
    "- I assume the rows in the logged prediction and loaded df are in the same order. -> but should be! -> if not error wouldn't make sense\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Found out: \n",
    "- Code is alright\n",
    "- Removing None or 0.99 or anything else gives bach a few features for each ds. But not really much.\n",
    "-> Can consider removing 0.99 from comparing. Too much compression different features.\n",
    "- The dim are already in the .txt file not in order!\n",
    "- Both functions seem to work. Simple test.\n",
    "- Also no overlapping features for comp_algos if ignoring Appliances\n",
